  * Always probe cpu support drivers. (LP #1207705)
  * On Dell PowerEdge systems, the iDRAC7 and later support a USB Virtual NIC
    for management. Name this interface "idrac" to avoid confusion with "real"
    network interfaces.
  * Drop numerical prefixes from patches, to avoid future diff noise when

  * The "Flemish Beef and Beer Stew" release.

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Do proper refcounting of the PAM module package on prerm, so that we
    don't drop the module from the PAM config when uninstalling a
    foreign-arch package.  Related to Ubuntu bug #1295521.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/udev.udev-finish.upstart: Fix path to tmp-rules,
    debian/extra/rule_generator.functions creates them in /run/udev/.
  * rules: Remove the kernel-install bits; we don't want that in Debian and
    thus it shouldn't appear in dh_install --list-missing output.
  * Ship sd-shutdown.h in libsystemd-daemon-dev.
  * Run dh_install with --fail-missing, to avoid forgetting files when we move
    to new versions.
  * Mount /dev/pts with the correct permissions in the udev, to avoid needing
    pt_chown (not available on all architectures). Thanks Adam Conrad.
  * Add new block of Windows Azure ethernet hardware address to
    75-persistent-net-generator.rules. (LP: #1274348, Closes: #739018)
  * Drop our Debian specific 60-persistent-storage{,-tape}.rules and use the
    upstream rules. They are compatible and do a superset of the
    functionality. (Closes: #645466)
  * Drop our Debian specific 80-drivers.rules and use the upstream rules with
    a patch for the sg module (see #657948). These now stop calling modprobe
    and use the kmod builtin, giving some nice boot speed improvement.
    (Closes: #717404)
  * Drop our Debian specific 50-udev-default.rules and 91-permissions.rules
    and use the upstream rules with a patch for the remaining Debian specific
    default device permissions. Many thanks to Marco d'Itri for researching
    which Debian-specific rules are obsolete! Amongst other things, this now
    also reads the hwdb info for USB devices (Closes: #717405) and gets rid of
    some syntax errors (Closes: #706221)
  * Set default polling interval on removable devices as well, for kernels
    which have "block" built in instead of being a module. (Closes: #713877)

  * Cherry-pick upstream fix for polkit permissions for rebooting with
    multiple sessions.
  * Kill /etc/udev/links.conf, create_static_nodes, and associated code. It's
    obsolete with devtmpfs (which is required now), and doesn't run with
    systemd or upstart anyway.
  * Drop unnecessary udev.dirs.
  * Add autopkgtests for smoke-testing logind, hostnamed, timedated, localed,
    and a compile/link/run test against libsystemd-login-dev.

  [ Marco d'Itri ]
  * preinst: check for all the system calls required by modern releases

  * Updated fbdev-blacklist.conf for recent kernels.
  * Do not blacklist viafb because it is required on the OLPC XO-1.5.
    (Closes: #705792)
  * Remove write_cd_rules and the associated rules which create "persistent"
    symlinks for CD/DVD devices and replace them with more rules in
    60-cdrom_id, which will create symlinks for one at random among the
    devices installed. Since the common case is having a single device
    then everything will work out just fine most of the times...
    (Closes: #655924)
  * Fix write_net_rules for systemd and sysvinit users by copying the
    temporary rules from /run/udev/ to /etc/udev/. (Closes: #735563)
  * Do not install sysctl.d/50-default.conf because the systemd package
    should not change kernel policies, at least until it will become
    the only supported init system.

  [ Michael Stapelberg ]
  * Add systemd-dbg package, thanks Daniel Schaal (Closes: #742724).
  * Switch from gitpkg to git-buildpackage. Update README.source accordingly.
  * Make libpam-systemd depend on systemd-sysv | systemd-shim. Packages that
    need logind functionality should depend on libpam-systemd.

systemd (204-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add preinst check to abort udev upgrade if the currently running kernel
    lacks devtmpfs support. Since udev 176, devtmpfs is mandatory as udev no
    longer creates any device nodes itself. This only affects self-compiled
    kernels which now need CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y.  Closes: #722580
  * Fix SysV init script to correctly mount a devtmpfs instead of tmpfs. This
    only affects users without an initramfs, which usually is responsible for
    mounting the devtmpfs.  Closes: #722604
  * Drop pre-squeeze upgrade code from maintainer scripts and simplify the
    various upgrade checks.
  * Suppress errors about unknown hwdb builtin. udev 196 introduced a new
    "hwdb" builtin which is not understood by the old udev daemon.
  * Add missing udeb line to shlibs.local. This ensures that udev-udeb gets a
    proper dependency on libudev1-udeb and not libudev1.  Closes: #722939
  * Remove udev-udeb dependency from libudev1-udeb to avoid a circular
    dependency between the two packages. This dependency was copied over from
    the old udev-gtk-udeb package and no longer makes any sense since
    libudev1-udeb only contains a library nowadays.

systemd (204-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Closes: #675175, #675177
    - In v183 the udev sources have been merged into the systemd source tree.
      As a result, the udev binary packages will now be built from the systemd
      source package. To align the version numbers 139 releases were skipped.
    - For a complete list of changes, please refer to the NEWS file.
  * Add Marco to Uploaders.
  * Drop Suggests on the various python packages from systemd. The
    systemd-analyze tool has been reimplemented in C.
  * Add binary packages as found in the udev 175-7.2 source package.
  * Wrap dependencies for better readability.
  * Drop hard-coded Depends on libglib2.0-0 from gir1.2-gudev-1.0.
  * Drop old Conflicts, Replaces and Breaks, which are no longer necessary.
  * Make libgudev-1.0-dev depend on gir1.2-gudev-1.0 as per GObject
    introspection mini-policy.  Closes: #691313
  * The hwdb builtin has replaced pci-db and usb-db in udev. Drop the
    Recommends on pciutils and usbutils accordingly.
  * Drop our faketime hack. Upstream uses a custom xsl style sheet now to
    generate the man pages which no longer embeds the build date.
  * Add Depends on libpam-runtime (>= 1.0.1-6) to libpam-systemd as we are
    using pam-auth-update.
  * Explicitly set Section and Priority for the udev binary package.
  * Update Build-Depends:
    - Drop libudev-dev, no longer required.
    - Add gtk-doc-tools and libglib2.0-doc for the API documentation in
      libudev and libgudev.
    - Add libgirepository1.0-dev and gobject-introspection for GObject
      introspection support in libgudev.
    - Add libgcrypt11-dev for encryption support in the journal.
    - Add libblkid-dev for the blkid udev builtin.
  * Use gir dh addon to ensure ${gir:Depends} is properly set.
  * Rename libudev0 → libudev1 for the SONAME bump.
  * Update symbols files. libudev now uses symbols versioning as the other
    libsystemd libraries. The libgudev-1.0-0 symbols file has been copied from
    the old udev package.
  * Run gtkdocize on autoreconf.
  * Enable python bindings for the systemd libraries and ship them in a new
    package named python-systemd.
  * Tighten Depends on libsystemd-id128-dev for libsystemd-journal-dev as per
    libsystemd-journal.pc.
  * Remove obsolete bash-completion scripts on upgrades. Nowadays they are
    installed in /usr/share/bash-completion/completions.
  * Rename conffiles for logind and journald.
  * Rename udev-gtk-udeb → libudev1-udeb to better reflect its actual contents.
  * Build two flavours: a regular build and one for the udev udebs with
    reduced features/dependencies.
  * Create a few compat symlinks for the udev package, most notably
    /sbin/udevadm and /sbin/udevd.
  * Remove the dpkg-triggered debian-enable-units script. This was a temporary
    workaround for wheezy. Packages should use dh-systemd now to properly
    integrate service files with systemd.
  * Update debian/copyright using the machine-readable copyright format 1.0.
  * Integrate changes from udev 175-7 and acknowledge the 175-7.1 and 175-7.2
    non-maintainer uploads.
  * Keep the old persistent network interface naming scheme for now and make
    the new one opt-in via net.ifnames=1 on the kernel command line.
  * Drop the obsolete udev-mtab SysV init script and properly clean up on
    upgrades.
  * Simplify the udev SysV init script and remove experimental and obsolete
    features.
  * Revert upstream commits which dropped support for distro specific
    features and config files.
  * Make logind, hostnamed, localed and timedated D-Bus activatable and
    usable when systemd is not running.
  * Store hwdb binary database in /lib/udev, not /etc/udev. Create the file on
    install and upgrades.
  * Provide a dpkg file trigger for hwdb, so the database is automatically
    updated when packages install files into /lib/udev/hwdb.d.
