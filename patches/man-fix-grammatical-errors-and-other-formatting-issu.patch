Subject: man: fix grammatical errors and other formatting issues

* standardize capitalization of STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR
* reword some sentences for clarity
* reflow some very long lines to be shorter than ~80 characters
* add some missing <literal>, <constant>, <varname>, <option>, and <filename> tags

(cherry picked from commit bcddd5bf8033b0c9cb15a9d017b7714ebe21473a)
