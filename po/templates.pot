"The currently running kernel has the CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED option enabled, "
"which is incompatible with this udev release.  If you are using the standard "
"Debian kernel packages and are in the process of upgrading from lenny to "
"squeeze, a compatible kernel package should be installed as part of this "
"upgrade.  If you are not using the Debian kernel packages or are not "
"currently upgrading the system, you must take action to ensure your kernel "
"is upgraded before the next reboot."

"Failing to upgrade to a kernel without CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED will probably "
"not prevent your system from booting, but will prevent certain udev rules "
"from being applied at boot time.  In particular, all block devices will be "
"owned by root:root (instead of root:disk), and network interfaces may be "
"named differently after reboots.  This latter issue may be a problem if you "
"are administering the machine remotely."
