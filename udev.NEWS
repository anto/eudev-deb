udev (0.140-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting from this release the last applicable NAME directive will be
  used instead of the first one: check any custom udev rules.
  The default rules files have been moved to /lib/udev/rules.d/ and
  /etc/udev/rules.d/ is supposed to contain only generated files or
  custom directives.
